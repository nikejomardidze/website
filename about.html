        <h1>welcome to the Luxe</h1>
        <p>Fashion is more than clothing — it is expression, culture, and quiet confidence. Our store was created as a curated space where timeless design meets modern elegance.</p>
        <p>We select pieces with intention, focusing on balance, quality, and simplicity. Every collection reflects a belief in effortless style — pieces meant to move with you, not overpower you.</p>
        <p>Historically, fashion has been shaped by cities and seasons. Paris, especially, defined elegance through its Automne / Hiver collections, where form, texture, and mood told stories beyond the runway. Fashion publications such as Vogue captured these moments, transforming style into a global language that continues to influence how we dress today.</p>

            <h1>Jane Birkin</h1>
            <p>Jane Birkin embodied effortless style and natural elegance, becoming an icon of understated fashion. Known for her relaxed silhouettes, minimal makeup, and timeless simplicity, she redefined femininity through authenticity rather than perfection.</p>
            <p>Her style was deeply connected to Parisian culture — unpolished yet refined, casual yet intentional. From oversized knits and tailored trousers to woven baskets and delicate details, Jane Birkin’s wardrobe reflected freedom, individuality, and quiet confidence.</p>
            <p>More than a muse, she represented a way of dressing that valued comfort, personality, and ease. Her influence continues to shape modern fashion, inspiring collections that celebrate simplicity, softness, and effortless charm.</p>
